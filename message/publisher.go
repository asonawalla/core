// Publisher maps, sequences, and asynchronously appends messages to Journals.
// It supports two modes of publishing: PublishCommitted and PublishUncommitted.
// Committed messages are immediately read-able by a read-committed reader.
// Uncommitted messages are immediately read-able by a read-uncommitted reader,
// but not by a read-committed reader until a future "acknowledgement" (ACK)
// message marks them as committed -- an ACK which may not ever come.
//
// To publish as a transaction, the client first issues a number of
// PublishUncommitted calls. Once all pending messages have been published,
// BuildAckIntents returns []AckIntents which will inform readers that published
// messages have committed and should be processed. To ensure atomicity of the
// published transaction, []AckIntents must be written to stable storage *before*
// being applied, and must be re-tried on fault.
//
// As a rule of thumb, API servers or other pure "producers" of events in Gazette
// should use PublishCommitted. Gazette consumers should use PublishUncommitted
// to achieve end-to-end exactly once semantics: upon commit, each consumer
// transaction will automatically acknowledge all such messages published over
// the course of the transaction.
//
// Consumers *may* instead use PublishCommitted, which may improve latency
// slightly (as read-committed readers need not wait for the consumer transaction
// to commit), but must be aware that its use weakens the effective processing
// guarantee to at-least-once.
